      <p id = "mediaP">Media, <button id = "alter" type="button" name="button">by altering the environment</button>, evoke in us unique ratios of sense perceptions. The extension of
any one sense alters the way we think and act–the way we perceive the world. When these ratios
change,  <button id = "change" type="button" name="button">we change</button>.
The dominant organ of sensory and social orientation in pre-alphabet societies was the ear– <button id= "hearing" type="button" name="button">“hearing
was believing.”</button> The phonetic alphabet forced the magic world of the ear to yield to the neutral world
of the eye. Humans were given an eye for an ear.<br><br>
Western history was shaped for some three thousand years by the introduction of the phonetic
alphabet, a medium that depends solely on the eye for comprehension. The <button id = "alphabet" type="button" name="button">alphabet</button> is a construct of
fragmented bits and parts which have no semantic meaning in themselves, and which must be strung
together in a line, bead-like, and in a prescribed order. Its use fostered and encouraged the habit of
perceiving all environment in visual and spatial terms–particularly in terms of a space and of a time
that are uniform, c,o,n,t,i,n,u,o,u,s and c-o-n-n-e-c-t-e-d.<br><br>
The line, the continuum became the organizing principle of life. <button id="go" type="button" name="button">“As we begin, so shall we go.”</button>
“Rationality” and logic came to depend on the presentation of connected and sequential facts or
concepts.<br><br>
For many people rationality has the connotation of uniformity and connectiveness.“I don’t follow
you” means <button id="edit" type="button" name="button">“I don’t think what you’re saying is rational.”</button>
Visual space is uniform, continuous, and connected. The rational human in our Western culture is a
visual human. The fact that most conscious experience has little “visuality” in it is lost on us.
Rationality and visuality have long been interchangeable terms, but we do not live in a primarily
visual world any more.<br><br>
The fragmenting of activities, our habit of thinking in bits and parts–“specialism”–reflected the step-
by-step linear departmentalizing process inherent in the technology of the alphabet.<br><br>
<button id="sound"type="button" name="button">“The eye–it cannot choose but see;
we cannot bid the ear be still;
our bodies feel, where’er they be,
against or with our will.”
–Wordsworth</button><br><br>
Until writing was invented, humans lived in acoustic space: boundless, directionless, horizonless, in
the dark of the mind, in the world of emotion, by primordial intuition, by terror. Speech is a social
chart of this bog.<br><br>
The <button id= "goose"type="button" name="button">goose quill</button> put and end to talk. It abolished mystery; it gave architecture to towns; it brought
roads and armies, bureaucracy. It was the basic metaphor with which the cycle of civilization began,
the step from the dark into the light of the mind. The hand that filled the parchment built a city.<br><br>
Whence did the wond’rous mystic art arise,
Of painting SPEECH, and speaking to the eyes?
That we by tracing magic lines are taught,
How to embody, and to colour THOUGHT?</p>
